# JustBuy - Technical Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
JustBuy is an e-commerce website I’m building where people can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and buy them online. The goal is to make shopping simple and smooth.

## 2. Technologies I’ll Use

| Part             | Technology/Tool           | Why I’m Using It                          |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Frontend         | HTML, CSS, JavaScript    | To create the website layout and style   |
| Frontend Framework (optional) | React.js or Vue.js  | To make the site interactive (if needed)|
| Backend          | Node.js with Express.js  | To handle user requests and manage data  |
| Database         | MongoDB or MySQL         | To store users, products, and orders     |
| Authentication   | JWT (JSON Web Tokens)    | To keep user accounts secure              |
| Payment Gateway  | Stripe or Razorpay       | To process payments safely                |
| Version Control  | Git + GitHub             | To keep track of changes in the code     |
| Deployment       | Heroku, Vercel, or AWS   | To put the website online                  |

## 3. How the App Works (Architecture)

Basically, the user interacts with the frontend (the website), which talks to the backend (the server). The backend handles data and talks to the database where everything is stored. When users pay, the backend connects to a payment service.

## 4. What I’ll Build and When (Roadmap)

| Step | Feature                         | What It Does                                | Importance |
|-------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1     | User Accounts                  | Allow users to sign up, log in, and log out| Must-have  |
| 2     | Product Listing                | Show products, allow searching and filtering| Must-have  |
| 3     | Shopping Cart                 | Add/remove products, update quantities      | Must-have  |
| 4     | Checkout & Payment            | Let users pay and confirm their orders      | Must-have  |
| 5     | User Profile & Orders         | Users can see their info and order history  | Nice-to-have|
| 6     | Admin Panel                  | Manage products and orders (optional)       | Optional   |

## 5. Database Overview

Here’s a simple idea of what info I’ll keep:

- **Users**: id, name, email, password (hashed), role  
- **Products**: id, title, description, price, image, stock, category  
- **Orders**: id, userId, list of products, total price, status  
- **Cart**: userId, list of products temporarily saved

## 6. API Endpoints (Rough Ideas)

These are the URLs the frontend will use to talk to the backend:

- `POST /api/register` — for new user sign-up  
- `POST /api/login` — for user login  
- `GET /api/products` — get all products  
- `POST /api/cart/add` — add something to the cart  
- `POST /api/checkout` — complete the purchase

## 7. How to Set Up and Run the Project

- Make sure Node.js and npm are installed  
- Clone the repo locally  
- Run `npm install` to get all the dependencies  
- Create a `.env` file with the necessary keys (database, JWT secret, payment keys)  
- Run `npm start` to launch the backend server
